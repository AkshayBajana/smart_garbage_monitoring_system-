# smart_garbage_monitoring_system-using blynk app and thingspeak
Introduction
The Smart Garbage Monitoring System is designed to optimize waste management by monitoring the fill levels of garbage bins in real-time. This system helps municipalities and waste management companies efficiently allocate resources, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact.

Features:
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks the fill level of each bin.

Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts when bins are nearly full, allowing for timely collection.

Data Visualization: Provides a dashboard for visualizing data and trends over time.

Mobile Compatibility: Accessible on mobile devices for on-the-go monitoring.

Scalability: Easily integrates additional bins or sensors as needed.

Hardware: Arduino/Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensors, Wi-Fi module (ESP8266, etc.)

**The main idea for these project is to connect multiple ultrasonic sensors to a single Nodemcu(ESP8266).inorder to know the garbage level of the each dustbin and send alert messages(text messgaes,E-mail alerts) through blynk app(blynk console).**
